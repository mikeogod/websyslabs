        // XMLHttpRequest object. For now, we just need the data.

          // This means it has already been converted from JSON to a JavaScript
          // object for us to manipulate.
 
          // For the sake of exploring JSON, let's have some fun with it now
          // that it's a JavaScript object. We'll iterate through our array of
          // individuals with the global $.each() iterator function.

          // Recall that data.people is an array.

            // We can access JSON parsed with parseJSON() just like any other
            // object's properties.
